.SYNOPSIS
  Build and publish a Cadence release — safely.

.DESCRIPTION
  Replaces `electron-builder --publish always`, which has a race that can put an
  INCOMPLETE release on GitHub:

    electron-builder creates one publisher per artifact (the .exe and its
    .blockmap). Both check "does this release exist?", both get "no", and both
    POST /releases ~25ms apart. GitHub creates one and rejects the other with
    422 "Published releases must have a valid tag". That rejection throws inside
    PublishManager.awaitTasks() BEFORE writeUpdateInfoFiles() runs — and that is
    the only place latest.yml is written. Result: a public release with an
    installer and no update manifest, which every electron-updater client is
    blind to. It is silent, and it has happened on v1.0.3, v1.3.5, v1.4.0, v1.4.1.

  This script decouples the two phases, which removes the whole class of failure:

    1. BUILD with --publish never. latest.yml is still generated (its creation is
       not gated on publishing) but nothing is uploaded, so no race can occur.
    2. ASSERT every artifact exists and is self-consistent BEFORE anything
       becomes public.
    3. PUBLISH with `gh`, one sequential upload at a time.
    4. VERIFY the manifest is actually fetchable from the release and names this
       version — the check that catches a partial publish while it can still be
       fixed.
